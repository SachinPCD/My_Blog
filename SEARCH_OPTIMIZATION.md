# Search Optimization Guide

## What's Been Improved

### 1. Live Search Implementation
- **Debounced Input**: Search triggers 300ms after user stops typing
- **Request Cancellation**: Previous search requests are cancelled when new ones start
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during search operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. Performance Optimizations

#### Frontend Optimizations:
- **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Request Cancellation**: Uses AbortController to cancel previous requests
- **Loading States**: Shows spinners and loading text for better UX
- **Memoization**: Uses useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Caching**: Browser can cache search results with appropriate headers

#### Backend Optimizations:
- **Enhanced Search**: Searches both title and description fields
- **Query Limits**: Limited to 100 results to prevent performance issues
- **Text Search**: MongoDB text search with scoring (requires indexes)
- **Regex Escaping**: Properly escapes special characters in search terms
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### Database Optimizations:
- **Text Indexes**: Full-text search indexes on title and description
- **Compound Indexes**: Optimized sorting by publishedAt
- **Weighted Search**: Title has higher priority than description in search results

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Set Up Database Indexes (Important!)
For optimal search performance, run this command once:

```bash
node scripts/setup-indexes.js
```

This will create the following indexes:
- Text index on `title` and `description` fields (with weights)
- Index on `publishedAt` for efficient sorting
- Unique index on `slug` field

### 3. Environment Variables
Make sure you have these in your `.env.local` file:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
DB_NAME=your_database_name
```

## Features

### Live Search
- Start typing in the search box
- Results update automatically after 300ms
- Search works on both title and description
- Shows loading spinner during search
- Displays result count

### Performance Features
- **Debounced Search**: Waits 300ms after typing stops
- **Request Cancellation**: Cancels previous requests
- **Caching**: Results are cached for better performance
- **Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations

### Search Capabilities
- **Case Insensitive**: Search is not case sensitive
- **Multi-field**: Searches both title and description
- **Real-time**: Updates as you type (with debouncing)
- **Weighted Results**: Titles have higher priority than descriptions
- **Special Characters**: Properly handles special regex characters

## Performance Tips

1. **Database Indexes**: Always run the index setup script for production
2. **Connection Pooling**: MongoDB driver handles connection pooling automatically
3. **Result Limits**: Results are limited to 100 items to prevent slow queries
4. **Caching**: API responses include cache headers for browser caching
5. **Text Search**: Uses MongoDB's built-in text search when indexes are available

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Search
- Make sure database indexes are created by running `node scripts/setup-indexes.js`
- Check if your MongoDB connection is stable
- Consider upgrading to a faster MongoDB tier if using cloud services

### Search Not Working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
- Ensure MongoDB connection string is correct in environment variables

### No Results Found
- Verify your database has posts with content in title/description fields
- Check if search terms match the content in your database
- Try simpler search terms
