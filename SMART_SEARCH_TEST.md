# Smart Search Implementation - Test Guide

## 🎯 Smart Search Features Implemented

### **Relevance-Based Ranking System**

The search now uses an intelligent scoring system that prioritizes results based on match quality:

1. **Exact Title Match** - Score: 1000
   - Perfect match gets highest priority

2. **Title Starts With** - Score: 500  
   - "Orange" for search "O" or "Or"

3. **Word Boundary Match** - Score: 300
   - "Optimize Database" for search "Opt"

4. **Title Contains** - Score: 200
   - Any title containing the search term

5. **Description Matches** - Score: 50-100
   - Lower priority for description matches

6. **Length Bonus** - Score: +25
   - Shorter, more focused titles get bonus points

2. **Optimize** Your Database... (starts with O) 
3. **Organic** SEO... (starts with O)
